<h2>COLLECTION OF INFORMATION</h2>

<h3>Collection and Use of Non-Personal Information</h3>

<p>Certain non-personal information about the Website visits is recorded by the standard operation of the Internet servers on which the Website is hosted. The non-personal information that we collect may include IP addresses, the type of operating system in use (e.g., Macintosh or Windows), the type of browser being used by the visitor (e.g., Firefox or Internet Explorer), the number and frequency of visitors to the Website, the website the visitor was on immediately before visiting the Website, and standard web log information, such as connection information, statistics on page views, traffic to and from the Website, and ad data. When you view the Website or use website features, we may collect certain non-personal information from you by using small text files known as “cookies.” We use cookies for several purposes, such as to recognize visitors to the Website, to determine the number of unique visitors to the Website, to ascertain which Website pages they visit, and to conduct internal reviews of the Website. We may associate information we collect via cookies with the personal information we collect online. We may use the combined information, for example, to personalize your experience on the Website or to personalize marketing communications we may send to you, as further described below. You are always free to decline cookies, but in doing so you may not be able to use certain features on the Website. The “help” segment of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to configure your browser to not accept new cookies, how to have the browser inform you when you receive a new cookie, and how to erase cookies from your hard drive. With cookies, the information that we collect and may share is anonymous and not personally identifiable. It does not contain your name, address, telephone number, or email address. Should we allow advertisers on our site, those advertisers may use cookies. We have no control over third-party cookies.</p>

<h3>Third Parties Providing Services On Our Behalf</h3>

<p>In order to carry out your requests, to make various features, services and materials available to you through the Website, and to respond to your inquiries, we may share your personal information with third parties that perform functions on our behalf (or on behalf of our partners), such as companies or individuals that: host or operate our Website; analyze data; provide customer service; mail products or manage payments; advertisers; sponsors or other third parties that participate in or administer our promotions or provide marketing or promotional assistance (such as in connection with winner selection, prize fulfillment, and as required by law, such as on a winners list).</p>

<h2>DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION</h2>

<p>We may disclose personal information if we are legally required to do so, to enforce our policies, to respond to claims that content you submitted violates the rights of others, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of third parties. We may also share your personal information with: entities or individuals that perform functions on our behalf, including, but not limited to, advertising, promotional, internet, and technical service providers (collectively, “Service Providers”) who help us with our business operations (such as website hosting, email compliance, data analysis, and fraud investigations); third parties to whom you expressly agree to share your information with; and law enforcement or other governmental officials, in response to a verified request relating to a criminal investigation or alleged illegal activity (we will disclose information relevant to the investigation, such as name, city, state, zip code, telephone number, email address, public alias history, IP address, fraud complaints, as well as project and entry history) or otherwise in response to the judicial process.</p>

<h2>SECURITY OF INFORMATION</h2>

<p>Your information is stored on servers located in the United States. A combination of encryption techniques and authentication procedures is used to maintain the security of your online session and to protect your account and our systems from unauthorized access. All of our employees and our independent contractors/agents must abide by this Privacy Policy. Only our authorized employees are permitted to have access to personally identifiable data about registered users, and that access is limited to what is reasonably needed to perform an employee’s responsibilities, such as providing updates or notices or customer service. However, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications, and may abuse or misuse your personal information that they collect or have unauthorized access to. Therefore, although we work very hard to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information or private communications will always remain private.</p>

<p>Transactions while logging in, registering, and in a logged in session are conducted in a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) session, which encrypts all transaction data for transmittal in a format designed to prevent theft of the information. While on a secure page, a lock will appear on the web browser and this lets you know that you are in a secured session. Our databases are protected from general employee access both physically and logically. We encrypt your account password so that your password cannot be recovered, even by us.</p>

<p>The Website is a general audience website. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of thirteen on the Website.</p>

<h2>UNFORESEEN CIRCUMSTANCES</h2>

<p>In the event that we or any of our assets are acquired by a third party, personal information acquired by us may be one of the assets transferred in such acquisition.</p>

<h2>THIRD PARTY WEBSITES</h2>

<p>We are not responsible for the policies, content, and practices of third party websites to which the Website may link. Please refer to those websites’ own privacy policies to learn how they collect and use personal information.</p>
