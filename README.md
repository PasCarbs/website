# Reddcoin.com Website

The relaunch of Reddcoin.com will be hosted on Github Pages and developed by the community.

A preview of the site can be seen here: [https://reddcoin-project.github.io/website/](https://reddcoin-project.github.io/website/)

The website is developed with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and styling with [Bootstrap 4](http://getbootstrap.com/). This allows for easy understanding of the template structure and open for contributions.

All contributions to the `master` branch require a pull request with a code review.

Roadmap for the relaunch of the website can be found in [Projects](https://github.com/reddcoin-project/website/projects/1).
